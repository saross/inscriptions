# Session Log — inscriptions

Factual record of what was done, decided, and produced each session.
Summarises; does not reflect — that's `session-reflection.md`.

Close each entry with a brief **Contextual assumptions** note where
non-obvious: decisions made under time pressure, tool/API constraints
that shaped approach, external dependencies that influenced choices.
Skip when context is self-evident.

*Entries appended by `/reflect`.*

## 2026-04-22 → 2026-04-23 — Entry 1

Continuous session, single session ID. Spanning ~14 hours across two calendar days.

**Done**

- Set up project scaffolding: `docs/notes/reflections/`, `planning/decision-log.md`, `planning/future-studies.md`, `planning/ai-contributions.md`, `planning/paper-outlines/`, `planning/memos/`.
- Verified bibliography (25 rows) + BibTeX for primary lit-scout chain (SDAM/Crema/Hanson cluster). Commit range through `2af64e4`.
- Supplementary lit-scout on Aeneas / ML-for-inscriptions (15 rows). Commit `2abdc83`.
- Installed `uv` on amd-tower; `uv init` + project venv with pandas, numpy, scipy, pyarrow, statsmodels, joblib. `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` committed (`6639fd5`).
- SSH-set up sapphire: uv installed, inscriptions repo cloned, `uv sync` reproduced the locked environment.
- Restored personal-assistant venv to pre-session state (uninstalled the 6 packages the first run added).
- Ran `data-profile-scout` (proposer) in comprehensive mode on sapphire: 5.64 min runtime, 1,305 claims, commit `32760ea`. Aoristic null, Westfall-Young stepdown with Holm-Bonferroni companion, BCa bootstrap (percentile fallback for n < 50), 20k resamples, joblib parallelism, assumption-check discipline in decisions.md.
- Ran `data-profile-verifier` on sapphire: PARTIAL verdict, 1303/1330 pass, 27 major corrections (none critical). Commit `8e64a21`. Method-as-implemented checks all pass.
- Committed planning state-of-play: Decision 7 (paper architecture), future-studies (FS-0/1/2), ai-contributions, Aeneas-partition outline, backlog update. Commit `3d61929`.
- Captured Obs 11 in working-notes: editorial-convention hierarchy hypothesis + Thursday test plan + post-LIST extension. Commit `78b2c0c`.
- Continuity message written. Commit `a72446c`.
- Reflection documents updated (this commit pending).

**Decided**

- Decision 7: main SPA paper deconvolution architecture — explicit deconvolution mixture as primary correction; thresholded SPAs as in-body robustness; stratified SPAs (convention vs precision) in appendix; baorista Bayesian (Crema 2025) run properly on a subset, reported in appendix as comparative methodology. Scope-commitment deadline end of Week 1 of paper sprint (Sunday 2026-05-03).
- OSF (not Zenodo, not AsPredicted) for preregistration deposits. Confirmatory/exploratory split adopted per Shawn's map-reader-llm precedent. Current rerun framed as exploratory; preregistration reserved for Friday's min-thresholds simulation and for Week-1-to-3 SPA analyses.
- Statistical-methodology review produced four refinements to the first-run plan (all applied before rerun): aoristic-probability null (Ratcliffe/Crema) replacing two-stage uniform; Westfall-Young permutation-based stepdown replacing Holm-Bonferroni as primary correction; required assumption-check discipline in `decisions.md`; stochastic-claim fields (`random_seed`, `resamples`, `method_parameters`, `code_location`) added to `claims.jsonl` schema.
- Thresholds for subset-qualification: `[10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000]` applied to province, urban-area, and bivariate province × urban-area levels. Matches archival working set.
- Project venv tooling: `uv` + `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` (FAIR4RS-aligned lockfile reproducibility).

**Produced**

- `runs/2026-04-23-descriptive-stats/` complete research record: spec, seed, agents.md, briefs, RO-Crate metadata, code (profile.py + verify.py), outputs (15 markdown files + 60 CSV tables + claims.jsonl with 1,305 claims + corrections.md + verdict.md + decisions.md with 14 entries), run.log and verifier.log.
- Two new verified bibliographies (primary + Aeneas-cluster) totalling 40 rows + BibTeX.
- Six new planning documents: decision-log, future-studies, ai-contributions, backlog, paper-outline for Aeneas-partition, memo on `/reflect` multi-invocation safety.
- Five reflection documents including this one and the continuity message.
- One new `[PATTERN]` working-notes observation (Obs 11, editorial-convention hierarchy) plus one captured earlier in the session (Obs 10, computational-sibling seeding).

**Contextual assumptions**

- `uv` chosen over `pip + requirements.txt` on FAIR4RS + modern-Python-convergence grounds; Shawn may not have encountered `uv` before today but accepted the recommendation.
- Sapphire workdir path `~/Code/inscriptions` (not `~/inscriptions`) — a path-typo in the first agent brief caused a stall; paths corrected throughout before re-run.
- Comprehensive-mode profile ran on sapphire not amd-tower per the "CRITICAL — run all compute-intensive analysis on sapphire" rule from scratchpad; 5.64 min runtime means local execution would have been viable, but the rule was observed regardless.
- First-run outputs in `runs/2026-04-23-descriptive-stats/outputs/` were overwritten by the rerun; first-run state preserved only in git history at commit `f254c4f`.
- Two first-run output artefacts (`profile_lire_v30.py`, stale `corrections.md`/`verdict.md`/`verifier.log`) were overwritten or superseded; no explicit cleanup commit separating the two runs.
